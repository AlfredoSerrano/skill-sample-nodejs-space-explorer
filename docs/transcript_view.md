## Overview

This is a full-screen image behind a title and source attributions, with text peeking at the bottom of the page to indicate users can scroll for more content. When this page is navigated to via voice (with the exception of Astronomy Images), the text is automatically scrolled into view, while Alexa speaks the content. While speaking, the corresponding line is highlighted. When Alexa has completed speaking, the text is scrolled back to the bottom of the page. Notice that when the page is scrolled a slight scrim appears over the image to increase legibility. With Astronomy Images, users say,_ “Alexa, tell me about it,”_ to start the synchronized speech. Text is styled using the alexa-styles package.

### Updates

Replaced the original highlight styling with updated styles that match the latest Alexa designs.
